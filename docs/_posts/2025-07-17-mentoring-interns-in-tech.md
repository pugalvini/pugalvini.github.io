          When I was asked to mentor a second-year college intern during a fast-paced product cycle, my first instinct was excitement—and nervousness. I had over 7 years of experience building full-stack solutions, leading feature teams, and navigating Agile ceremonies. But guiding a fresh intern? That was uncharted territory.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300">
          Looking back, I learned just as much as I taught. Here's what I wish I had known before taking up the mentor role, so you can be better prepared if you find yourself in similar shoes.

      <section class="mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. You're Not Just a Senior—You're Their First Real-World Influence</h2>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Most interns come from an academic background where success is about grades, not impact. It took me a while to realize that my role wasn't just assigning tasks—it was helping them transition from textbook knowledge to practical thinking.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-blue-400">What worked:</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>I started introducing her to <strong>Agile rituals</strong>—standups, retrospectives, and sprint planning—and asked her to shadow real story before owning any.</li>
            <li>Gradually, I asked her to write test cases, investigate bugs, and demo small features to the team.</li>
            <li>This scaffolding helped her build confidence in a safe, supportive environment.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Structure Their Learning (But Not Too Much)</h2>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Interns thrive on structure—but too much structure kills curiosity. Early on, I made the mistake of spoon-feeding. She completed tasks, yes—but she wasn't thinking critically.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-blue-400">My approach shifted to:</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>Creating a <strong>2-month roadmap</strong> with goals like "Basic Node.js" or "GCP interface".</li>
            <li>Including <strong>hands-on, not just theory</strong>, e.g. asking her to introduce a small feature based on the existing code.</li>
            <li>Leaving <strong>"buffer hours"</strong> in her week for self-exploration or asking "why" behind things.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Communicate Like a Teacher, Not a Reviewer</h2>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            As developers, we're used to short PR comments: "refactor", "naming?", "optimize this." But interns need the why behind every feedback.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-blue-400">So I started using:</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li><strong>Loom videos</strong> for feedback walkthroughs</li>
            <li><strong>Weekly syncs</strong> to reflect on "what went well and what confused you?"</li>
            <li>Encouraging her to write <strong>end-of-week reflections</strong>, which helped both of us track her growth.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Expose Them to the Real Deal (Within Boundaries)</h2>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Too often, interns are treated as side projects. But giving her real code—our event ingestion service with trace ID logging, GCP Datastore writes, and external API handling—made her feel truly involved.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">
            Yes, I had to double-check everything she did. But her learning was 10x faster. And she took immense pride in seeing logs she wrote show up in production traces (with guardrails, of course!).

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>A <strong>sharper eye</strong> for articulating technical concepts simply</li>
            <li>More <strong>patience</strong> (seriously!)</li>

          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>Start with <strong>shadowing sessions</strong> before assigning independent work</li>
            <li>Create a <strong>learning journal</strong> to track progress and challenges</li>
            <li>Set up <strong>regular check-ins</strong> but keep them informal and conversational</li>
            <li>Encourage <strong>questions</strong>—there are no stupid ones in learning</li>

            Mentoring is not just about shaping someone else's journey. It's about reshaping how you think, teach, and grow as a developer and a leader. If you're stepping into this role—don't wait to be perfect. Be present, be patient, and be human.

            Have you mentored an intern before? I'd love to hear what you learned too. Drop your stories in the comments!
